# Automated-Proctoring

The proposed Automated Proctoring System is a technology-based solution designed to ensure the integrity and security of online exams. The system combines various tools, including webcams, facial recognition, computer vision, head-pose tracking, eye tracking, and audio recording, to prevent cheating and maintain a reliable examination environment. Unlike traditional invigilation methods, this automated system can efficiently detect subtle changes in facial expressions that may not be easily noticed by human proctors.

1. Webcam-Based Facial Recognition:
The system utilizes a webcam to track and identify the examinee's facial features accurately. It employs facial recognition algorithms to verify the identity of the test-taker and ensure that the correct person is taking the exam.

2. Head-Pose Tracking:
During the head-pose detection phase, the examinee is required to position themselves directly in front of the camera. The system then continuously tracks the examinee's head-pose using computer vision techniques. Any significant deviation or movement away from the camera can trigger warnings or raise suspicions.

3. Eye Tracking:
To further enhance cheating detection, the system incorporates eye tracking technology. It monitors the movement and focus of the examinee's eyes throughout the exam. This helps identify instances where the test-taker may be looking at unauthorized materials or attempting to communicate with someone else.

4. Mouth Tracking:
Another aspect of the system involves mouth tracking, which monitors the movements of the examinee's mouth during the exam. Unusual mouth movements, such as whispering or speaking, can indicate potential cheating attempts.

5. Audio Environment Monitoring:
To ensure a comprehensive examination environment check, the system records audio samples from the student's surroundings. This allows for the detection of voice assistants or any other unauthorized audio aids that the examinee might be using during the test.

The entire process is fully automated and does not require any prior knowledge of the input signals, making it efficient and user-friendly for both test-takers and exam administrators. If the system detects any suspicious behavior, it can trigger warnings, notify the proctor, or even pause the exam for further investigation.

Benefits of the Proposed System:
1. Enhanced Cheating Detection: The combination of facial recognition, head-pose tracking, eye tracking, mouth tracking, and audio monitoring significantly improves cheating detection compared to traditional online proctoring methods.

2. User-Friendly: Examinees do not need to be familiar with the system's workings, as the process is automatic and transparent to them.

3. Real-Time Alerts: The system can issue real-time alerts to proctors if suspicious activities are detected, allowing for immediate intervention if necessary.

4. Remote Exam Conduct: The proposed system enables secure and reliable remote exams, eliminating the need for physical exam centers.

5. Efficient and Accurate: With advanced computer vision and facial recognition technologies, the system can efficiently detect even subtle cheating attempts, ensuring the exam's integrity.

It's important to note that while automated proctoring systems offer significant benefits in ensuring exam integrity, there may also be privacy and ethical considerations related to the use of facial recognition and audio monitoring. Appropriate measures should be taken to address these concerns and ensure compliance with relevant regulations and guidelines.
